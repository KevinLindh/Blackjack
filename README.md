My learning focused on building a functional Blackjack game with the help of APIs.

## Optimizations

Through using localStorage to save the credits. These will be available even across browser sessions. Getting values and card images from the API simplifies and optimizes to code from the start.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned that managing variables in different scopes can be tricky when the codebase get large so comments and abstraction go a long way to remedy these issues.
